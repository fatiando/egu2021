# Script for the vPICO 2 minute talk

> This is a guide for my 2 minute presentation.






We have been developing these tools for only a few years and are still evolving
their goals and scope.

We want to invite this community to provide input and get involved in the
projects.

You can do so by joining our Slack chatroom, attending an open monthly
community call, and engaging with development on GitHub.

We are friendly and welcoming group with a range of different backgrounds.

There are links and more information about all of that on our website
www.fatiando.org.

There is also a link in the abstract display materials for further information,
including a recent tutorial and the code to generate the figures shown here.

Thank you and we look forward to hearing from you!
